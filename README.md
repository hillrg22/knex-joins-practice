# Basic Express Server: Express Router & Modularization

## Objectives

* Integrate Express Router into a server
* Modularize server routes
  - Separate routes into their own folder
  - Refactor route endpoints to be modular

## Resources

* [Express Docs - Router](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router)

## Notes

* What is Express Router?
  - Handles middleware
  - Referred to as a "mini-app"
    * Self-contained
    * Can be used in other parts of app
  - Handles routing functions
  - Recreate same functionality of having every route in app.js but with the benefits of modularization
  - Just an object
  - How do we use the Router?
    * As middleware

* Modularize server routes
  - Separate routes into their own folder
    1. Create routes folder and route file
    2. Require express library
    3. Capture the express.Router() in a variable
    4. Export the router with module.exports
  - Routers must be used as middleware with app.use() at the correct place in the app's pipeline
    * After middleware
    * Before error handlers



# Basic Express Server: Deploy to Heroku

## Objectives

* Deploy an express server to Heroku
* Use Heroku logs to debug deployment issues
* Configure server code to use environment variables

## Resources

* [Heroku Docs - Deploy Node.js App Tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
* [Heroku Docs - Heroku Logs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#view-logs)

## Notes

* Make sure start script is correct in package.json
  ```json
  "start": "node app.js",
  "dev": "nodemon app.js"
  ```
* Make sure PORT is being set dynamically with environment variable in app.js
  ```js
  const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
  ```
* Bring in CORS package and enable it as middleware in app.js
  - `$ npm install cors`
  ```js
  const cors = require('cors')

  app.use(cors()) // Above routes
  ```
